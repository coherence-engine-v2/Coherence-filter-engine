# üß† Coherence Filter Engine (LoC-F)

A logic validation layer powered by the Logic of Coherence (LoC) framework.

This module detects broken or illogical game-world states using rule-based logic evaluation. Designed for runtime and editor-time validation across game engines.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Rule Format (`LogicRuleSet.json`)

```json
{
  "id": "is-dead-but-has-health",
  "description": "Dead characters should not have health above 0.",
  "ifCondition": {
    "parameter": "isDead",
    "comparator": "eq",
    "value": "true"
  },
  "thenRequirements": [
    {
      "property": "health",
      "comparator": "eq",
      "expectedValue": "0"
    }
  ],
  "message": "Character is marked dead but has non-zero health."
}
```

## üß© Supported Logic Properties

| Property     | What It Means                                |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `isDead`     | Whether the character is marked as dead       |
| `health`     | Current health value                          |
| `isVisible`  | Whether the object is being rendered          |
| `ammoCount`  | Ammo remaining in a weapon                    |

You can expand this by adding your own properties in `GetLogicProperty()`.

## ‚ú® Features

- Runtime logic validation  
- JSON rule system (readable, editable, expandable)  
- Supports: `isDead`, `health`, `ammoCount`, etc.  
- Comparators: `eq`, `ne`, `gt`, `lt`, `gte`, `lte`  
- Integrates with in-editor or runtime debugging  

**Extendable to:**

- Behavior trees and state machines  
- Inventory, combat, and quest systems  
- Multiplayer state sync validation

## üß† Based on the LoC Framework

This is a core logic module for the broader Coherence Engine Stack, which includes:

- ‚úÖ [Coherence Visual Validator (LoC-V)](https://github.com/coherence-engine-v2/Coherence-Visual-Validator)  
- üß† Coherence Filter Engine (Logic Layer)  
- üß™ Coherence-Physics (future physical consistency layer)  
- ü§ñ Coherence-AI (logic-driven NPC validation)
